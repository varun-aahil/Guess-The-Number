**"Guess the Number"** is a classic and simple game where one player thinks of a number, and the other players try to guess it based on hints provided by the first player. Here's how to play:

### How to Play Guess the Number:

1. **Choose a Range**:
   - Before the game begins, decide the range of numbers from which the secret number will be chosen. For example, you can choose a range from 1 to 100, 1 to 50, or any other range that suits the players.
   
2. **Select the Secret Number**:
   - One player (the "host") thinks of a secret number within the chosen range but does not reveal it. The number should be kept a secret until the guessing phase is over.

3. **Start Guessing**:
   - The other players take turns guessing the secret number. They say a number out loud, and the host will give them feedback based on whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number.

4. **Feedback**:
   - After each guess, the host provides one of the following hints:
     - "Higher" – the secret number is greater than the guessed number.
     - "Lower" – the secret number is less than the guessed number.
     - "Correct" – the player has guessed the right number.

5. **Continue Until Correct**:
   - Players continue guessing, using the hints provided to narrow down the possible numbers. The first player to guess the secret number correctly wins the round.

6. **Optional - Keep Score**:
   - If you want to play multiple rounds, you can keep track of the number of guesses it takes for each player to find the correct number. The player who guesses the secret number in the fewest guesses wins the round.

### Example:

- The host selects the number **42**.
- Player 1 guesses **30**.
  - Host says: "Higher."
- Player 2 guesses **50**.
  - Host says: "Too Low! Try Again"
- Player 1 guesses **40**.
  - Host says: "Higher."
- Player 2 guesses **42**.
  - Host says: "Correct!" Player 2 wins!

### Tips:
- Start with a wider range to make the game more challenging.
- Keep the feedback clear and concise to avoid confusion (e.g., just say "Higher" or "Lower").
- For faster play, you can set a limit on the number of guesses each player has.

This game is simple, quick, and can be played anywhere, making it perfect for all ages! Enjoy the challenge!
